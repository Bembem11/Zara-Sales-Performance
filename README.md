## Findings and Insights
### 1. Sales Performance
 - Zara has generated a total revenue of $39,018,228 based on both volume and pricing, especially with high-value items such as jackets, which contribute significantly to the revenue.
 - Zara has achieved a high volume of sales with 459,573 total units sold. This shows that Zara's products have strong demand across various categories and also successful promotional strategies.
 - Average sales per product indicate a balanced sales performance across the clothing type.

 ### 2. Sales by Product Placement
 - Products placed in the Aisle generated the highest sales volume by 177,396 units, followed by End-cap with 152,930 units and while Front of Store placement shows 129,247 units.
- This shows that products placed at Aisle and End-cap are highly effective at attracting customer attention and driving sales
 
 ### 3. Clothing Types
 - Jackets are the top-performing product clothing types, generating 189,249.82 average total sales, followed by Shoes 122,357.13 average total sales.
 - Sweaters have the lowest sales volume with 99,932.41 average total sales among the clothing types.

 ### 4. Sales Performance by Section (Men vs. Women)
 - 86.51% of the clothing types belong to the Men's section, while the Women's section accounts for only 13.49% . Men’s section leads in sales, with 396,199 sales compared to the Women’s section at 63,374 sales.
 - This suggests that the men's products are performing significantly better, or there are more products available to the men's section and with the small percentage of women's products, their sales are substantial. 

### 5. Promo Impact on Sales
- 52.38% of the products are sold during promotions, indicating that promotional activities play a key role in driving sales.
- However, the fact that 47.62% of sales occur without promotions suggests that many products perform well even at full price indicating a balanced strategy.

### 6. Average Prices by Clothing Type
- Jackets have the highest average price at 105.70, while T-Shirts are the cheapest at 7.50.
- There is a sharp price drop between Jackets and other categories, especially T-Shirts and Shoes, which could reflect on Zara's strategy of offering a mix of high-priced and budget-friendly items. 

### 7. Seasonal Sales
- Jackets and Sweaters play a significant role in Zara’s seasonal strategy, particularly in colder months, with jackets taking the lead.
- The low seasonal count of Jeans is not heavily promoted or adjusted in stock according to the seasons, but they remain an essential product type.
  

## Recommendation
- Jackets significantly contributing to the total revenue and sales volume, Zara should consider expanding the jacket category by introducing new designs and increasing marketing efforts for jackets especially during their peak season.
- However, increasing promotional efforts, using discounts or seasonal sales for jeans and sweaters could boost their performance

### Product Placement 
- Products placed at the Aisle and End Cap tends to attract more customer attention and generate more sales than Front of Store, Jackets and Shoes can be placed there to ensure high visiblity and also captalize on their high demand.
- Seasonal products like sweaters can be strategically placed in high-traffic aisle sections during peak seasonal periods to improve customer awareness of seasonal collections.
- Jeans can be paired with t-shirts or jackets to encourage cross-selling and drive higher sales.

### Promo and Season 
- Women’s section has lower sales volumes compared to men’s, so we can increase sales by flash sales, influencer partnerships, or even enquiring on the latest fashion to know what to stock up on.
- Sweaters tend to sell well during colder months. We can run promos during the peak season by offering limited-time discounts or exclusive online promotions.
- Jackets perform well without promo so Zara can consider limiting discounts on their best seller

### Section 
- Women’s clothing accounts for only 13.49% of the total products but still generates a substantial number of sales, there’s potential to increase revenue by expanding the women's product line like introducing new designs, marketing campaigns, or promotions targeted specifically at jeans, t-shirts, and shoes to cater to a broader range of preferences and drive more sales.

### Clothing Types
- Jackets and shoes are top-selling clothing types based on total sales and revenue. They can expand the line by introducing more variations, designs, and colors.
- The clothing types with the least sales and revenue like Jeans and Sweaters, Zara can offer limited-edition or trendy styles to attract customers.
- They can also cross sell jeans and sweaters with the high performing types offering discounted prices (e.g., a jacket paired with jeans) to  improve performance in these underperforming categories.
- Zara can explore current fashion trends such as sustainable clothing lines, influencer-inspired collections to spark new interest and restore customer engagement in these categories.

  ### Price
 - Zara can lower their prices or offer temporary discounts for the underperforming cllothing types to drive sales. Introduce more affordable options or basic lines in these categories could attract price-sensitive customers.
 - Zara can compare their prices with competitors especially for popular items like jackets and t-shirts to make sure prices are competitive, while emphasizing Zara’s unique style and quality to justify any price differences.
 - Zara can offer multiple price options e.g basic, mid-range, and premium versions, to cater for customers of different budgets.
